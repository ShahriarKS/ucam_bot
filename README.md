# UIU UCAM Academic Monitor

An automated Python-based desktop application designed for students of United International University (UIU). This tool monitors the [UCAM portal](https://ucam.uiu.ac.bd/) in the background to track academic grades and notifies the user immediately if any new updates are detected.

## 🚀 Features
* **Automated Tracking:** Periodically checks the UCAM portal for grade updates every 30 minutes.
* **Real-time Alerts:** Automatically brings the application to the foreground and alerts you when a new grade is posted.
* **Privacy First:** Your credentials are stored locally in a JSON file on your computer—never sent to any external server.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with `tkinter` for a clean, intuitive dashboard with features like a password show/hide toggle.
* **Lightweight:** Optimized to consume minimal system resources.
